# accessible-image-gallery

A simple mobile-first image gallery with a focus on responsiveness and accessibility

## Features

- Full screen image display with gallery automatically set to landscape or portrait depending on device settings.
- Designed to test srcset attribute - each image exists in several resolutions and automatically switches depending on display size.
- Ability to choose between differnt categories of image galleries.
- Ability to navigate currently selected gallery via keyboard arrow keys or the left and right on-screen arrows. These are clickable or activated via spacebar.
- Images in current gallery will loop around when they reach the start or end.
- All interactive sections of the website set to be tabbable and interactive via multiple ways.

## Still to do

- Figure out how to best deal with the default displayed image (so it displays correctly regardless of orientation).
- Add an icon with tooltip (top right?) explaining functionality and shortcuts. Possibly code to auto-activate upon reaching end of a gallery for the first time?
- Add media queries to maintain best functionality and look regardless of device/display size.
- With the above, possibly add selectable thumbnails instead of the side arrows on larger displays.
- Probably best to consider best image resolutions/breakpoints in srcset before completing gallery.
- Finish adding the galleries and test it all displays correctly.
- Ensure all images have appropriate alt tags.
- Implement category button functionality and styling (along with ability to switch between).
- Implement accessibility such as ARIA elements and other relevant attributes.

## Possible feature additions

- More images/gallery categories
- Increased interactivity via keyboard interaction.
